# Connections

A C++ application that mimics the functionality of social media apps.

Data Structures used: Graphs

‘Connections’ depicts the real world application of graphs in social media platforms by showcasing how different users can expand their social network based on mutual connections. We have used three basic levels in our project: 
	Primary - Direct connection
	Secondary - Have mutual connections
    Tertiary -  Third level connections
These levels are generally used as recommendations and for different data studies.
In this project, we have attempted to mimic the structure of LinkedIn. Users can add and remove connections. Users can also search for other users and check in what level they are connected.
